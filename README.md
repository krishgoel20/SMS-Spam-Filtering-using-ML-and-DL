# SMS-Spam-Filtering-using-ML-and-DL

Due to the ubiquity of mobile phones and the extensive usage of Short Message Service (SMS), SMS spam has become a major annoyance to smartphone users. In this project, we propose a complete solution that combines state-of- the-art deep learning techniques with standard machine learning approaches to filter SMS spam. To extract pertinent features from SMS texts, such as lexical, syntactic, and semantic properties, we first investigate feature engineering and selection strategies. Then, using these features, traditional machine learning models like Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are trained. Our suggested approach offers a scalable and effective way to filter SMS spam, giving customers better defense against unsolicited messages while minimizing false positives and maximizing classification accuracy. This work advances the field of spam detection systems and has important ramifications for improving security and user experience in mobile networks.

Nearly every nation is plagued by the SMS spam message issue, which is growing and shows no signs of abating as the number of mobile users increases in addition to cheap rates of SMS services. Therefore, this project presents the spam filtering technique using various machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques. Different algorithms will provide different performances and results based on the features used. For future works, adding more characteristics like message durations could aid the classifiers in training data better and give better performance.
